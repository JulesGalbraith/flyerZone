<p>
Hello!<br><br>
This site is a tentative towards platform divestment and uhhhh lets say digital rewilding. Of the community, I guess. As @ContentFactoryFarm on tw put it, "Pre-facebook events Halifax just had a long scrolling webpage of show posters, basically a digital telephone pole, and it worked great."
<br>Yeah, sounds like it would work great! Anyways, if this expands at all I don't mind making a couple extra tabs so that event flyers can be filtered by city. Right now, it's mtl centric baybeee</p>
<p>If you have a Flyer you would like to circulate, please email <span id='emphasis'> theflyerzone@gmail.com </span> with an image, 72 dpi (please), in .pdf, .jpg, .png, or .gif if u fancy. .mp4 if u mf fancy but lets keep the site weight down, ey?<br><br>
bisous & happy linking</p>
